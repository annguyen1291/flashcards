For the UdaciCards project, you will build a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

To get started:
* install all project dependencies with yarn install
* start the development server with yarn start

Tested on Android emulator
